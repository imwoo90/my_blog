Dioxus is an incredible framework that brings the power of Rust to the web via WebAssembly. In this post, I'll share the unique development workflow I used to create this blog—from initial AI-assisted design to final deployment on GitHub Pages.

## The Vision: A New Era of Development

Building a modern web application today isn't just about writing code; it's about orchestrating powerful tools. This project serves as a blueprint for how **AI-augmented design** meets **high-performance systems programming**.

## 🎨 Phase 1: Designing with Stitch

The journey started with a visual vision. Instead of coding CSS from scratch, I used [Stitch](https://stitch.withgoogle.com/) to design the blog's interface. 

- **Stitch Design Project**: [Explore the Canvas](https://stitch.withgoogle.com/projects/12286301471497023600)
- **Outcome**: A premium, high-fidelity UI mockup with tokens ready for the next stage.

## 🏗️ Phase 2: Setting up the Foundation

While the design was being finalized, I prepared a clean **Dioxus** base project. I initialized a standard Dioxus web app and pushed it to a GitHub repository. This acted as the "skeleton" where the design and logic would eventually live.

## 🔗 Phase 3: The Bridge - Jules

It's important to note that **Stitch** doesn't directly generate Dioxus `rsx!` macros; its output is typically clean HTML/CSS. To bridge this gap, I used **Jules** (Google's autonomous coding assistant). 

Jules took the design output from Stitch and intelligently **merged** the layout and styles into my pre-prepared Dioxus GitHub repository. This automated merge saved hours of manual translation, giving me a solid UI foundation inside the Rust workspace.

## 🤖 Phase 4: Refinement with Antigravity

With the design-driven code in place, I turned to **Antigravity**. As a powerful agentic AI coding assistant, Antigravity handled the heavy lifting of the application's core logic:
-   **Dynamic Content Architecture**: Transitioning from static embedding (`include_dir!`) to a scalable folder-based system.
-   **Automated Indexing**: Implementing a `build.rs` script that scans `public/content/` and generates JSON metadata indexes at compile time.
-   **Runtime Fetching**: Using `gloo-net` to asynchronously fetch Markdown content only when a user navigates to a specific post.
-   **Image Resolution**: Crafting a custom Markdown-to-HTML pipeline that automatically resolves relative image paths inside post folders to their correct URLs on GitHub Pages.

## 🚀 Phase 5: Hosting on GitHub Pages (Zero-Config)

The final step was ensuring the world could see it. We refined the deployment workflow to be completely automated, removing the need for manual path configuration:

### 1. Automated `base_path` Injection
Instead of hardcoding the repository name in `Dioxus.toml`, our GitHub Actions workflow now detects the repo name at build time:
```yaml
      - name: Set Base Path
        run: |
          REPO_NAME=$(echo ${{ github.repository }} | cut -d'/' -f2)
          sed -i "s/base_path = \".*\"/base_path = \"$REPO_NAME\"/" Dioxus.toml
```

### 2. The `<base>` Tag Solution
To ensure the app always knows its location, we manually inject the `<base>` tag into `index.html` during the CI process. This provides a reliable source of truth for all relative asset requests.

### 3. Dynamic Path Detection in Rust
In the application code, we use a robust utility to read the environment at runtime:
```rust
pub fn get_base_path() -> String {
    // Reads <base href="..."> from the DOM
    // Returns "" on localhost and "/repo_name" on GitHub Pages
}
```
This synergy ensures that whether we are developing locally with `dx serve` or deploying to a subpath on GitHub, the blog always fetches the correct Markdown and images.

## 💡 The Synergy of Agents

The true magic of this project isn't just in the tech stack (Rust/Dioxus), but in the **Synergy of AI Agents**:
- **Stitch** focuses on the *Aesthetics*.
- **Jules** handles the *Integration*.
- **Antigravity** masters the *Implementation*.

This workflow allows a single developer to build state-of-the-art applications with the polish and performance of a full engineering team.

## Conclusion

This blog is more than a place for my thoughts; it's a testament to the future of software development. By combining **Rust's raw power** with **AI's creative speed**, we can reach new horizons in web development.

If you're interested in building a similar blog, check out the **[GitHub Page using Dioxus](/projects/github-page-using-dioxus)** project page for the template and deployment details.

Happy coding!
